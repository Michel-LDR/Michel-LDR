# Hi! I'm Michel, a Junior Full-Stack Developer 👋

I'm an early-career Full-Stack developer focused on building functional, well-structured web applications with a real purpose. I come from a practical background outside of technology and bring the same mindset to development: learning by doing, solving problems, and constantly evolving.

## About Me

I'm currently transitioning to a development career, focusing on modern web applications using JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I enjoy understanding how things work behind the code and strive to create complete projects, connecting front-end, back-end, and databases, always applying best practices and improving with each project.
